This repository contains the projects I had done during my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions as a Python programmer.
The projects are:
1. ATM Interface Project
2. Inventory Management Service Project

In the ATM Interface Project, the user can deposit and withdraw money as well as check their balance.
In the Inventory Management Project, the user can add product details like Coffee ID, Coffee Name and Stock details. A graph would also be plotted for the items in    stock.
